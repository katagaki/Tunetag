A batch MP3 tag editor built for iOS.

**Download: [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/3VvkvbCO)**

## Development

### What works
- Viewing and opening MP3 files
- Viewing, editing, and saving ID3 tags in MP3 files (including album art!)
- Batch editing ID3 tags
- Using tokens to fill out ID3 tags using existing data (such as filenames)
- Extracting ZIP files

### What's planned
- Support for more kinds of tokens
     - Track numbers embedded in the filename in various formats
     - Support for more kinds of splits (currently only supports the dash symbol, and requires a space before and after the dash)
     - Support for full-width numbers
- Support for fetching metadata from DMM or DLsite (particularly for 同人音声 or other ASMR tracks)
